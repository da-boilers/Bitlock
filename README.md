# Bitlock
This application attempts to solve a growing issue in identification tracking. With bitlock, your various ID's can be stored in a digital and secure manner. 

A Bitcoin-like blockchain algorithm is used to hash, store & authenticate a user's various ID's.

While never completed, this project taught each team member a lot about blockchain development and it's inner workings.

Developed at the 2019 Mhacks (University of Michigan) hackathon.
